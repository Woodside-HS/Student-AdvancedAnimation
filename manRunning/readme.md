# Man Running

This project contains a spritesheet with a sequence of twelve images that animate a cartoon man running.  It also contains a json file with data for the spritesheet.

One potential use for the spritesheet would be to string together the images to animate the cartoon man to run from one side of the canvas over to the other side and then turn around and run back again.  Then repeat endlessly.

The sample starter code takes the first image of the spritesheet and draws it on one side of the canvas and then draws the same image on the other side of the canvas but flipped to face the opposite direction.

The task for the student would be to learn how to extract the necessary information from the json file and draw the correct images from the spritesheet in the right place at the right time to create the animation.
